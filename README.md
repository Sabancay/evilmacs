# My Emacs configuration

This is my configuration for Emacs 28.
As I grew up with vi, I am lost without evil-mode.

The Know-How for the configuration was stolen from several competent Emacs power users.
I keep a subdirectory "steal-from* where I keep interesting Emacs-configurations I found on the Internet.

I use chemacs2 to load between different Emacs configurations.
The following shows a highlevel view of files that together form my Emacs setup. They are all in one place,
so that they can be easily backupped.

~/emacsen
   _emacs-profile
   _emacs-profiles.el
   abbreviations
   *evilmacs*
   fonts
   reveal
   server
   snippets
   steal-from
   testfiles
   *testmacs*
   treesitter
